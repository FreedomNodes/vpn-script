#!name=GroupAuto
#!desc=Preferred node: (speed: persistent cache) (average delay: persistent cache) returned by httpApi
#!system=ios
#!category=Panels
#!author={{user.name}}

#Function:
# If the policy group node changes, the result will be re-cached and re-valued.
# If a node occasionally fails to ping, there is a high probability that it will not be selected.
# If a node has low latency but poor speed, it will not be selected.
# Strategy:
# Optimize nodes based on the node speed and delay (persistent cache) returned by the api

#Panel description:
# Inherited: Tokyo: 40C 6.54M 61 [Tokyo] represents the preferred node, [40C] represents the number of times, [6.54M] represents the maximum speed, [61] represents the comprehensive score that changes non-linearly according to speed and delay
# GroupAuto VPS'4 17:41 [VPS] represents the preferred policy group name ['4] represents 4 nodes in the policy group
# â™³,â™´,â™µ,â™¶,â™·,â™¸,â™¹, means more than 30 caches have been cleaned

#Required parameters:
# group= Your policy group name (you need to fill in the manually selected policy group select)

# Optional parameters:
# avgnumber=30 The number of cache node tests. If it exceeds the number, it will be cleared.
#Tolerance=10 The tolerance is 10ms. If the tolerance is less than 10ms, the node will not be switched.
# timecache=18 Cache expiration time (hours) or more than 40 data will clear old data
# push Add parameters to enable notification, add no parameters to not notify
